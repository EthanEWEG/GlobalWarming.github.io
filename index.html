        <h1><b>The Global Warming Catastrophe</b></h1>
        <div class="index-div1">
            <img src="images/earth.gif" alt="spinning earth" id="spinning-earth">
            <p>Almost everyone has heard of climate change. It's a continuously evolving challenge we are facing around the world. Rising temperatures and 
                earth’s increasing volatile climates have been key indicators for the ongoing shifts. The worst is only yet to come, yet no extensive efforts 
                have been made in reducing the main culprits behind greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="index-div2">
            <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are <b>still</b> on the rise globally. In fact, even if emissions were to flatline <b>today</b> it wouldn’t even be 
                close to enough to prevent or slowdown the increase of volatile climates. The <strong>real solutions</strong> to start <b>reducing</b> c02 
                emissions require too much of a sacrifice for our quality and comfort that we’d rather let our world burn (sometimes quite literally). As 
                the problem has become more and more mainstream fake solutions have become more and more popular as well, often in the form of “greenwashing”.</p>

        <div class="index-div3">
            <h4>Two notable examples of fake solutions are:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly processed foods, wrapped in single use plastic, and packaged in single use cardboard boxes are placing "green" labels on their products such 
                    as “made with reusable plastics”. Which in reality is the complete wrong approach to getting rid of plastics </li>
                <li>Canada telling their citizens to recycle but then actually shipping the waste to another country (usually China, Indonesia, or the Philippines) 
                    so they don’t have to build their own infrastructure to deal with the waste or face any consequences for dumping the garbage. </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>Although there are MANY other examples...</p>
