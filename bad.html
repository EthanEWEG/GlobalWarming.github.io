            <p>The examples above are just a glance into some of the repercussions we are currently facing due to climate change.</p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The drastic increase in <b>floodings</b> is caused in large part due to the warmer temperatures which hold more moisture in the atmosphere. This in-turn causes more intense rainfalls. 
                    Every degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature results in potentially 4% more water vapor in the air per some estimates.</li>
                <li>Although <b>Forest fires</b> are a part of the natural life cycle of a forest, recent increases in forest fires have been detrimental to many regions due to the destruction they bring. 
                    As global warming continues to increase, so will <b>forest fires</b>, which will continue to displace and destroy certain regions.</li>
                <li>The melting <b>Ice caps</b> in the north and south poles due to the heating atmosphere are rising sea levels around the world. This is catastrophic for many cities and ecosystems that 
                    are already close or at sea level (especially the ecosystems that were dependant <i>ON</i> the ice caps like polar bears).</li>
                <li>The rapid heating of the earth due to <b>rising temperatures</b> from continuously growing c02 emissions clearly causes lots of other problems. However the heating of our atmosphere 
                    itself is a huge problem. Droughts will (and already are) going to become much more common in certain regions.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>Many countries are now being forced to potentially take corrective action against the effects of global warming, such as building huge dams deep in the ocean to prevent increasing water 
                levels. The Netherlands is most notable for this, with all their major cities directly at sea level, have proposed a mega dam out in the ocean to prevent the loss of their cities. This 
                would be one of, if not the, largest civil engineering challenge ever undertaken and would cost between 250-500 billion euros.</p>
            <br><br>
                <p>More and more investment will have to be put into corrective measures as global warming intensifies. Drinking water sources are drying up everywhere and this alone will cause significant 
                economic, social, and environmental impacts. Whether it be food loss, mass migration and conflict, or complete collapse of certain ecosystems and speciesâ€¦ <i>Soon we will be asking 
                ourselves why we never started taking stronger preventative measures sooner.</i></p>
