# My Reflection On Assignment 1

For this assignment I decided to go with the subject of global warming. Specifically a website that outlined what solutions are to come (or already here) and the consequences of global warming. My website assumes a base understanding of global warming as a concept. I picked this topic because I wanted to learn more about it and because I think it's a serious problem that isn't nearly talked about enough in the politcal arena (the most important place for changes to come from).

I've worked on a few websites before while in school however I thoroughly enjoyed this one more than others (even though it took me way longer than I thought it would) because of the liberty of the assignment, but also the very clear expectations in the grading outline. I found myself not trying to "just get it done" and started experimenting with lots of really cool css features, api's, and learning about why different things do different things on websites. In the end I scrapped my api because I couldn't find one readily available that could provide anything related to my website and the ai generated api's, which would've been perfect, were broken. 

In the end I still implemented some cool features to the website that I had never tried before, such as the fading around all sides of an image on "the bad" page. Also the page loading transition was really cool to see work and was especially easy to implement, as was the random quote generator in JS. 

In future classes I hope to learn about anything that will help me improve my web dev skills. Whether a better understand of commonly used css attributes or maybe learning some I never knew about.
